Text: Introduction to Liner Algebra  
Exercise/Matlab/syllbus/video: **[https://mitmath.github.io/1806/](https://mitmath.github.io/1806/)**

* n liner equations,n unknowns
* Column picture
* Matrix form

Example one: (two by two system)   
2x-y=0  
-x+2y=3  

* write down the Matrix form;
* To draw their Row picture;  
* We find a important point that lies on both lines(solve both equations)  
* To draw their Column picture;  
(find liner combination of columns: column one and two multiply some right number and add,to get the vector right hand of equal )  
* **[What will happen if all x and y were shown]**

Example two:(three by three system)  
2x-y+0z=0  
-x+2y-z=-1  
0x-3y+4z=4  

* write down the Matrix form;
* To draw their Row picture;
* Put all the points that satisfy that equation one and two(bunch of point become a plane\_one)  
* Again second equation meet at a plane\_two (plane\_one and plane\_two just give a line)  
* Final three thing(plane\_one two three) meet at a point;  
* To draw their Column picture;(we got three column and each one is a three dimesional vector)  
* How to combine three columns into the right-hand side;  
* **[Could solve Ax=b（any slutions） for every b == do the liner combinations of the columns fill three dimensional space]**   
(non-singular matrix,invertible matrix)  
* Ax=b mean 'A' times ‘x’,multiply a matrix by a vector,to find right-hand side 'b'  
* Each row multiply a column (dot product)
